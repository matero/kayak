============================================================================================================

Simple Kotlin to develop little tiny agile monolithic webapps using plain servlets as starting point.
It's inspired by many little toolkits saw in my spare time :).

Based on simple and known tools:
* [JDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/) as platform
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (at least 1.5) as language
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) as build tool  (no installment need [maven wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper) is configured)
* [Jakarta Servlets 5.0](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/) as servlet reference
* [Jetty 11.0.x](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) (only for testing)
* [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/) for logging support
* [kotest](https://github.com/kotest/kotest) for testing
