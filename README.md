Kayak: light webapp library
=================================

Simple Kotlin kit / library to develop monolithic webapps using plain servlets as starting point.

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (at least 1.5)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (at least 3.8.1, don't worry it has excellent maven wrapper)

It's inspired by many little toolkits saw in my spare time :).
