Kayay: light AppEngine utilities
=================================

Simple Kotlin kit / library to access native java facilities over AppEngine. See the [Google App Engine standard environment
documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kayak/docs/java/) for more detailed instructions.

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (at least 1.1)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (at least 3.5)
* [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) (aka gcloud)

It's inspired by the excellent toolkit developed for groovy, [gaelyk](http://gaelyk.appspot.com/).
